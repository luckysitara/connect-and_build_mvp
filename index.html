<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
Connect and Build was inspired by me from people's experiences and frustrations within the civil engineering and construction industry. Looking at the stories about the challenges faced in finding the right professionals, artisans, or companies for various projects sparked the idea for this platform. Witnessing the inefficiencies and roadblocks encountered, I became determined to create a solution that would streamline the process and facilitate seamless connections within the industry.
This project is not just a requirement for Holberton School; it is a passion project that I've poured my heart and soul into. Drawing inspiration from my uncle's experiences and fueled by my own desire to make a meaningful impact, I embarked on a journey to bring Connect and Build to life.
